###HearthstoneXml
Builds card information XML files from cardxml0.unity3d.

For the most part based on [hearthstonejson](https://github.com/Sembiance/hearthstonejson).

###Xml Files
If you are just looking for the xml files and don't want to build this yourself, you can find those [**here**](https://github.com/Epix37/HearthstoneXml/tree/master/HearthstoneXml/XmlFiles/3.0.0.9876). I will try to keep it updated for new Hearthstone builds.
